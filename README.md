# Termcolor convertor

I wanted a way to convert colorscheme formats from one terminal emulator
settings to the other.

Currently, this thing takes an `.Xresources` and gives a foot terminal color
config.

## Starting the project

```sh
$ npx serve app
```

or

```sh
$ python3 -m http.server app
```
